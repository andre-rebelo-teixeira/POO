/**
 * This is an Abstract Class that creates the baseline for what an event is in

 * element of the
 * simulation that it will affect. The event will be extended in multiple other
 * classes, each
 * having its own handle function, allowing for polymorphism.
 *
 * The `GenericEvent` class provides a foundation for defining specific events
 * in the simulation,
 * encapsulating common properties and behaviors. Each subclass will implement
 * specific details
 * of the event handling.
